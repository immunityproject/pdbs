Original PDB imported into PyMol via “fetch 4xr8” and saved as a new molecule, 4xr8-abcdfh.pdb.

Individual chains were opened up in PyMol via “fetch 4xr8-a”, “fetch 4xr8-c”, and “fetch 4xr8-f” for chains A, C, and F, respectively. Files were individually saved molecules as 4xr8-a.pdb, 4xr8-c.pdb, and 4xr8-f.pdb.

One biological assembly, or chains A, C, and F, were saved by importing the entire PDB via “fetch 4xr8”, showing the sequence, selecting the sequence for the corresponding chains including hydrogen and additional molecules, then saving the molecule selection as 4xr8-acf.pdb.
